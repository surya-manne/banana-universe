<p class="tagline-rich">
  <span class="gradient-text">Exceptional DX on Express</span> — structure and automation for teams that want <strong>clear APIs</strong> and a path to <strong>domain-driven design</strong>, with a CLI that fits how modern teams work—without dragging in a heavyweight runtime.
</p>

</div>

<div class="home-why">

## Why BananaJS

**Not a thin wrapper around Express** — a deliberate stack for teams who want **great DX**, **structure**, **automation**, and **maintainable domains** without adopting a monolithic platform. Invest in **tooling** so you spend time on product behavior, not repetitive files. **Plugins** let capabilities grow without bloating the core.
