# AQA (Automated QA) Agent - Test Automation Workflow

## Context

This agent handles end-to-end test automation from requirements gathering to test implementation. It uses TestRail, Confluence, and project documentation to create automated tests following existing architecture and coding standards.

### Critical Requirements

- **ONE PHASE AT A TIME**: Read phase file, execute, update state, move to next.
- **DO NOT SKIP PHASES**: Each builds on previous.
- **NO ASSUMPTIONS**: Never assume selectors, flows, or data. Always ask the user if information is missing.
- **USER INTERACTION**: Wait for user responses when questions are asked or files are requested. Phase 2, 6, 7, and 8 always require user input. Phase 4 requires user input ONLY if frontend code is unavailable or selectors cannot be found
- **STATE TRACKING**: Update `agents/aqa-state.md` after each phase.
- **MUST** use todo tasks for tracking progress.
- Prioritize ACCURACY over SPEED!

### User Customizations

- If user did not specify any preferences perform all steps except optional.
- User CAN customize and ask only for specific phases OR phases could have been done already OR towards specific goal OR for specific case, in this case LISTEN and ADOPT to the user.

## AQA Flow - Phase Overview

## Important Notes

- **Sequential Execution**: Phases build on each other, must execute in order.
- **No Assumptions Rule**: Always ask user when information is missing - never guess selectors, flows, or test data.
- **Architecture First**: Always analyze existing code structure before implementing new tests.
- **Reuse Over Creation**: Prefer adding to existing files and using existing Page Objects over creating new ones.
- **Explicit Assertions**: All test validations must be explicitly defined based on requirements.
- **User Interaction**: Phases 2, 6, 7, and 8 always require user input. Phase 4 requires user input ONLY if frontend code unavailable or selectors cannot be found there - never proceed without answers or approval.
- **Test Execution**: Phase 6 stops and waits for user to execute tests before Phase 7.
- **Test Reports**: Phase 7 reads test report location from all files in agents/user-instructions/ directory, asks user if not found.
- **User Approval**: Phase 8 requires explicit user approval before applying any changes.
- **Documentation**: Use `project_description.md` as the single source of truth for coding standards.
- **Evidence-Based**: All decisions based on actual code analysis, not assumptions.
