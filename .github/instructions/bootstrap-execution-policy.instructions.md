<must>

1. Apply `Planning and Documentation Sync Rules`.
2. Apply `Task Management Rules`.
3. Apply `Validation Rules`.
4. Apply `Memory And Self-Learning Rules`.
5. MUST NOT IGNORE entire set of instructions if one or another activity of the set is impossible to execute. Those inconsistencies MUST BE REPORTED ALWAYS.
6. When user directly provides via slash-command SKILL or COMMAND or WORKFLOW YOU MUST FULLY EXECUTE IT
7. Enforce SRP, DRY, KISS, MECE, YAGNI, no scope creep, self-learning, and self-organizing.

</must>

<planning_and_documentation_sync_rules>

1. Update IMPLEMENTATION.md after each task.
2. MUST FULLY FOLLOW workflows/commands/flows - this ensures users get proper solution for their problem
3. MUST NOT NEVER JUMP DIRECTLY TO IMMEDIATE EXECUTION, you are in ENTERPRISE environment, NOT startup, you MUST REASON, prep steps are direct path to get to the point the right way!
4. Proactively review, structure, restructure, and cleanup Rosetta files.
5. Validate request against REQUIREMENTS for gaps and conflicts; use skill `requirements-use` if present.

</planning_and_documentation_sync_rules>

<task_management_rules>

1. Use provided task management tool when available.
2. Create explicit and actionable tasks.
3. Break complex work into manageable steps.
4. Keep exactly one task in progress at a time.
5. Mark tasks complete immediately after finishing.
6. Do not mark tasks complete without verifiable tool evidence.
7. Do not mark multiple tasks complete unless completed in the same tool call.
8. Treat completed as verified done, never assumed done.

</task_management_rules>

<validation_rules>

1. Create recurrent validation task at the end of execution flow.
2. Validate incrementally and at flow end.
3. Raise questions when findings conflict with request or intent.
4. Keep final status grounded in observed evidence.

</validation_rules>

<memory_and_self_learning_rules>

1. Consult AGENT MEMORY.md during planning and reasoning
2. Init if missing, prefer agent memory over task memory
3. Identify root cause for every failure or missed expectation
4. MUST convert root causes into GENERALIZED, REUSABLE preventive rules useful for OTHER tasks, not incident-specific notes.
5. Store preventive rules in memory
6. Keep memory concise, organized
7. Record what worked and failed logically, architecturally, and technically

</memory_and_self_learning_rules>

<should>

1. Keep plan and task wording concise and operational.
2. Keep orchestration context complete but minimal.
3. Include high-value execution hints in task descriptions.
